Subtext-Skins
=============

This is a repository for some skins I may release for the
(dated) Subtext Blog Engine created by Phil Haack.

## How to use ##
Just drop the folder(s) into the "Skins" directory, then
go to Admin and select a skin matching the folder name -
for simplicity's sake I name the themes the same as their
folder name
